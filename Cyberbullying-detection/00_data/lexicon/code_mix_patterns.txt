# Source: kannad english.csv, kannada.csv, bad_words.csv
# Patterns observed in cyberbullying context
# ==========================================

## 1. SENTENCE STRUCTURE PATTERNS

### Pattern A: Kannada Base + English Insult
Template: [Kannada pronoun] + [English insult/adjective] + [Kannada verb ending]
Examples:
- "nee full stupid idiya" (You are full stupid)
- "avanu tumba toxic agidane" (He has become very toxic)
- "nanna fake friend madkondu" (Making me a fake friend)

### Pattern B: English Base + Kannada Fillers
Template: [English sentence] + [Kannada particles: re, maga, yaar]
Examples:
- "You are such a loser maga"
- "Stop being toxic re"
- "Why are you so fake yaar"

### Pattern C: Mixed Vocabulary
Template: Alternating Kannada-English words
Examples:
- "Class nalli ee behavior beda" (This behavior not needed in class)
- "Group ge spam madbeda" (Don't spam the group)
- "Lecture miss aaytu but notes share maadi" (Missed lecture but share notes)

## 2. PROFANITY MIXING PATTERNS

### Kannada Profanity in English Context
- "You are such a gaandu in this group"
- "Only a thotha will do this"
- "Stop being a soolya"

### English Profanity with Kannada Grammar
- "Nee asshole tara behave madthiya"
- "Ivan stupid maga"
- "Group nalli ee bastard attitude beda"

### Euphemistic Code-Switching
- Using English when Kannada term is too harsh
- Using Kannada when English seems too direct
- Switching mid-sentence to soften/intensify

## 3. CYBERBULLYING-SPECIFIC PATTERNS

### Threat Formation
Kannada structure + English threat words:
- "Ninage complaint haakthini" → "I will file complaint against you"
- "Consequences face maadu" → "Face the consequences"
- "Regret madthiya nodu" → "You will regret, see"

### Exclusion Language
- "Ivanu group ge belong agalla" (He doesn't belong to group)
- "Selected people only, nee out"
- "Illi ninge place illa, just leave"

### Stalking/Harassment
- "Nanna movements yak track madthiya" (Why are you tracking my movements)
- "Online status always check madthidya" (Always checking online status)
- "Every post ge comment madbeda re" (Don't comment on every post)

## 4. INTENSIFICATION PATTERNS

### Degree Modifiers
Kannada intensifiers with English adjectives:
- "tumba irritating" (very irritating)
- "sakkat dumb" (extremely dumb)
- "full toxic" (completely toxic)
- "swalpa annoying" (a bit annoying)

### Repetition for Emphasis
- "Fake fake fake nee"
- "Bore bore aaytu"
- "Waste waste fellow"

## 5. TARGET REFERENCE PATTERNS

### Direct Address
- "[Name] maga, ..." (addressing with 'maga')
- "[Name] re, ..." (addressing with 're')
- "Aye [Name], ..." (calling out)

### Third Person Reference
- "Ivanu/Ivalu tumba..." (He/She very...)
- "Aa [group] hudguru..." (Those [group] guys...)
- "Ee batch nalli..." (In this batch...)

## 6. GRAMMATICAL MARKERS

### Question Formation
English question + Kannada verb:
- "Why ee tara madthiya?" (Why do you do like this?)
- "What problem ide ninge?" (What problem do you have?)

### Negation Patterns
- "Don't message madbeda" (Double negative emphasis)
- "Never again helidre, illa" (Never again, I said, no)

### Conditional Threats
- "Once more maadidre, then see" (If you do once more, then see)
- "Adu repeat aadre, complaint file madthini" (If that repeats, will file complaint)

## 7. EMOJI + CODE-MIX

### Emoji Placement
- End of sentence: "Nee tumba irritating 😒"
- Mid-sentence emphasis: "Ivanu 🤡 tara act madthidane"
- Replacement for words: "Nanna ❤️ hurt maadidya"

## 8. DETECTION IMPLICATIONS

### High-Risk Patterns
1. Kannada profanity + English sentence = Often more severe
2. Multiple intensifiers = Heightened aggression
3. Threat verbs in English + Kannada target = Direct threat

### False Positive Risks
1. Casual banter uses same particles (maga, re, yaar)
2. Playful insults among friends
3. Sarcasm markers may be missed

### Recommended Handling
1. Weight code-mixed profanity higher than single-language
2. Consider context window for intensity assessment
3. Track conversation history for pattern detection
